1.General reflction about the course: During the IBI1 course, I learned how to work with numbers, strings, functions and algorithms using
python. And I also got the basic knowledge of  navigating a Unix-like system. During the practial courses, since I have never learned about
python before, I found it hard to complete the task by myslef at first, so I spent a lot of time searching for online sources to get a better understanding
about some basic python coding skills, and I also asked teachers as well as classmates for help. Therefore, my coding skills improved gradually
and I found although programming is not easy, it is really an interesting process.

2.Reflection about the formative feedback: I am really sorry for mistakenly placing the portfolio in wrong place at first and I reuploaded them to the 
right repository immediately after recerving the feedback. I also corrected all the mistakes pointed out in the feedback. Additionally, I rechecked my 
codes and made some other changes to improve them after the corrections.
