This was my first time to learn to use gitkraken and github. It was unsurprising that things did not go well all the time because I basically knew little about computer. At first, I spent some time trying to figure out how to create new files and edit it on gitkraken, and I felt really confuesed at the beginning since everything seemed quite unfamiliar to me. Additionally, I even wrongly named the file as "thingsIlike.txt.txt" , which made me a little annoyed with myself. However, I found that it was even more difficult for me to complete the work well when I was upset. Fortunately, I managed to calm down and tried to understand the instructions carefully, and posted my questions on the discussion board to ask for advice. I also learned and worked together in the wechat group with some friends.Eventually, I was able to solve all the problems and completed the tasks successfully, and I also found this practical really interesting. Not only did I gain new knowledge, but also I learned and improved with my classmates together. It was a nice experience and I really looked forward to the next practical.
