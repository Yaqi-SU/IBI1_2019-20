A short summary about my findings and the interpretation
I wrote a python script to output the sum of the scores between human and mouse,
human and random, mouse and random. The output scores I obtained are 1091
(human-mouse), -250(human-random), and -250(mouse-random). I also wrote codes
to output the corresponding alignments as well as the hamming distance. In "human
 -mouse",  the hamming distance is 23 and there are 4 "+", which indicates the
conservative substitutions between these two amino acids that will not likely
to cause huge impacts on the functions of the protein. In "human-random",  the 
hamming distance is 210 and there are 23 "+" presented. The hamming distance of 
"mouse-random" is 209 and there are 22 "+"presented. The percentage identities of 
"human-mouse", "human-random", "mouse-random" are 89.69%, 5.83%, and 6.28%.
From the BLOSUM62 matrix I found that the substitutions matching to each other have
relatively high postive scores while the negative scores are all for the substitutions that are
different from each other. Therefore, I think the higher the sum scores are, the higher the
similarity between two sequences will be. 
I found that the sum scores of "human-mouse" is relatively high and the hamming distance 
of it is quite short, which indicates that there is a high similarity between SOD2_human and 
SOD2_mouse. Considering the biological meaning, the high similarity between human and 
mouse sequences also indicates that human and mouse, which are both mammals, may share 
a common ancestor.
However, both the scores of "human-random" and "mouse-random" are very low, 
which are negative. And their hamming distances are both relatively large, which are over 90% 
of their lengths. These show that the similarity between human and random, mouse and random 
are low.
